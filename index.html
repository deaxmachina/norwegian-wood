Born to middle-class parents on Helicon, Arcturus sector (where his father, in a legend of doubtful authenticity, was a tobacco grower in the hydroponic plants of the planet), he early showed amazing ability in mathematics. Anecdotes concerning his ability are innumerable, and some are contradictory. At the age of two, he is said to have. . . </p>

										Each of the main characters of the book other than Toru - 
										<span class="name">Naoko</span>, <span class="name">Midori</span>, <span class="name">Reiko</span>
										 - is represented by one butterfly. Butterflies flap their wings as characters exchange words with each other.

								<p>
									A line of dialogue spoken amongst them becomes one colourful patch in the Voronoi region of one of their wings,
										with each complete dialogue forming a Voronoi cluster. 
									The bigger and more saturated the colour of the 
										patch, the longer that character spoke for uninterrupted. 

								</p>
								The central butterfly for Toru stands out as being different. He does not have a complex Voronoi web, but 
								only a simple ever-changing pattern.
